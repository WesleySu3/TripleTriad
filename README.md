This repository contains an in-progress AI that will play the Triple Triad card game from Final Fantasy VIII. I plan to implement toggles for all possible rules like plus/same.

The inspiration for this project was me getting mad at the CPU beating me with plus/same/combo/random. Consequently, I will allow the player to set the values on the cards manually so that they can use this AI while playing FF8. I could write a massive text file that contains the values of every card in FF8, but I don't plan to at the moment since this project is meant to be more of a calculator than a real deck-building game.

As far as I know, no Final Fantasy game has PvP Triple Triad, so I'm not worried about people using this AI to cheat.
